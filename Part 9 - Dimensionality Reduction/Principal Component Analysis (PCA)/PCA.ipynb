    "### Problem Statement  \n",
    "__the wine owner gathered all the information of the independent variables that are chemical's information of several wines and he applied some clustering technique to find some segments of customers, each segment having a specific preference for a specific wine , so he found three types of wines each type of wine corresponding to one segment of customers and therefore three segments of customers  \n",
    "and why does it creates added value for its business? well that's because now business owner can do is take all these informations of the wines as well as the info of about the customer segments and make a classification model like logistic regression in which independent varaible are all these variable and dependent variable is the customer segment it should recommend this wine  \n",
    "So the logistic regression model that we're going to build is going to return the customer segment that each new wine should be recommended to,so that adds a lot of value to this business owner__  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  __but then if this business owner wants to have a clear visual look at the prediction regions and the prediction boundary of the classification model that hat we're going to build to be able to see if the predictions are in the right spot of the customer segments.  \n",
    "Well it cannot be done with all these independent variables because of course we cannot represent these many independent variables in one plot.__"

    "According to the extracted features of all the informations of our independent variables. And remember these extracted features are called the principal components.  \n",
